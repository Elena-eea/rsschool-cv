## About me


I started my career as a translator. Mostly, I translated various technical documents, including Engineering and IT documentation. I loved my job but one day I realized that I was stuck in one place and did not move forward. So, I decided to switch my career path and try myself in programming. I am confident that my 10-year experience as a translator will help me succeed in the new field I’ve chosen.


Adaptability, critical and creative thinking, motivation, and problem-solving are among my soft skills. I’m a responsible and non-conflict person.


I believe that my ability to learn fast and work hard will allow me to become a proficient Frontend Developer.
